summary: Multi-platform BLE to MQTT gateway leveraging Theengs Decoder
description: |
    Theengs Gateway is a multi-platform, BLE to MQTT gateway that leverages the
    Theengs Decoder library. It retrieves data from a wide range of BLE
    sensors, including the LYWSD03MMC, CGD1, CGP1W, H5072, H5075, H5102, TH1,
    TH2, BBQ, CGH1, CGDK2, CGPR1, RuuviTag, WS02, WS08, TPMS, MiScale, LYWSD02,
    LYWSDCGQ, and Mi Flora. It translates these data into a readable JSON
    format and pushes those to an MQTT broker.
